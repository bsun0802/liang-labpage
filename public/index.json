Current statistical models to identify differentially expressed genes between disease and control groups often overlook the substantial human sample heterogeneity. Meanwhile, traditional nonparametric tests lose detailed data information and sacrifice the analysis power, although they are distribution free and robust to heterogeneity. Here, we propose an empirical likelihood ratio test with a mean-variance relationship constraint (ELTSeq) for the differential expression analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). As a distribution-free nonparametric model, ELTSeq handles individual heterogeneity by estimating an empirical probability for each observation without making any assumption about read-count distribution. It also incorporates a constraint for the read-count overdispersion, which is widely observed in RNA-seq data. ELTSeq demonstrates a significant improvement over existing methods such as edgeR, DESeq, t-tests, Wilcoxon tests and the classic empirical likelihood-ratio test when handling heterogeneous groups. It will significantly advance the transcriptomics studies of cancers and other complex disease.","tags":["RNA-seq","Modeling","Differential Expression"],"title":"An empirical likelihood ratio test robust to individual heterogeneity for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1509087600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509087600,"objectID":"7c4ac368d3a2b303c43e27501b289d95","permalink":"/project/robust-regression-eqtl/","publishdate":"2017-10-27T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/robust-regression-eqtl/","section":"project","summary":"Study the performance of robust regression models in conventional eQTL analysis.","tags":["Modeling"],"title":"Robust Regression in eQTL","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1503298800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1503298800,"objectID":"d6aa8d1b46320b82a951b7bfc5db6377","permalink":"/project/single-cell-cluster/","publishdate":"2017-08-21T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/single-cell-cluster/","section":"project","summary":"study ways to identify cell type and subclass from single-cell RNA-seq profiling","tags":["Modeling","RNA-seq"],"title":"Identify cell subtypes from single-cell RNA-seq data","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.

However, it is well known that inappropriately accounting for pedigree or population structure leads to spurious associations. GWASs have often encountered increased type I error rates due to the correlated genotypes of cryptically related individuals or subgroups. Therefore, accurate pedigree information is crucial for successful GWASs.**Results:** We propose a distance-based method KIND to estimate kinship coefficients among individuals. Our method utilizes the spatial distribution of SNPs in the genome that represents how far each minor-allele variant is located from its neighboring minor-allele variants. The SNP distribution of each individual was presented in a feature vector in Euclidean space, and then the kinship coefficient was inferred from the two vectors of each individual pair. We demonstrate that the distance information can measure the similarity of genetic variants of individuals accurately and efficiently. We applied our method to a synthetic data set and two real data sets (i.e. the HapMap phase III and the 1000 genomes data). We investigated the estimation accuracy of kinship coefficients not only within homogeneous populations but also for a population with extreme stratification. **Conclusions:** Our method KIND usually produces more accurate and more robust kinship coefficient estimates than existing methods especially for populations with extreme stratification. It can serve as an important and very efficient tool for GWASs.**Keywords:** GWAS, HapMap, Kinship, Population structure, SNP, 1000 Genomes","tags":["GWAS"],"title":"Inference of kinship using spatial distributions of SNPs for genome-wide association studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Academic is a framework to help you create a beautiful website quickly.

However, there are significant challenges in the analysis of RNA-seq data, such as how to separate signals from sequencing bias and how to perform reasonable normalization. Here, we focus on a fundamental question in RNA-seq analysis: the distribution of the position-level read counts. Specifically, we propose a two-parameter generalized Poisson (GP) model to the position-level read counts. We show that the GP model fits the data much better than the traditional Poisson model. Based on the GP model, we can better estimate gene or exon expression, perform a more reasonable normalization across different samples, and improve the identification of differentially expressed genes and the identification of differentially spliced exons. The usefulness of the GP model is demonstrated by applications to multiple RNA-seq data sets.","tags":["RNA-seq","Modeling"],"title":"A two-parameter generalized Poisson model to improve the analysis of RNA-seq data","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
