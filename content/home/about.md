# Welcome to Liang's Lab

My long-term research goal is to develop statistical and computational methods to discover the underlying principles of gene expression regulation in eukaryotes, and to explore how variations or defects in gene regulation cause phenotypic variation or diseases. My current research focuses on transcriptome analysis (e.g., RNA-seq data analysis) and post-transcriptional regulation analysis (e.g., alternative splicing analysis). In addition, I am interested in genome-wide association studies to identify genetic variants underlying diseases or other quantiative traits.
